## 📌 Abstract

Machine Translation (MT) is a transformative technology that enables seamless communication across linguistic barriers, supporting global trade, education, and cross-cultural interaction.  

This research presents the development of a multilingual translation pipeline utilizing **mBART** and **NLLB** models through Hugging Face's `transformers` library.  

- **mBART** excels in high-resource language translation.  
- **NLLB (No Language Left Behind)** is optimized for low-resource languages.  

The system leverages advanced Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms to deliver accurate and fluent translations. Performance evaluation using BLEU scores demonstrates high translation quality for high-resource languages and adequate contextual accuracy for low-resource language pairs.

This work highlights the power of open-source NLP tools in enabling scalable, real-time multilingual communication.

## 🌍 Introduction

In today's globalized world, efficient multilingual communication is essential for overcoming linguistic and cultural barriers. Machine Translation (MT) plays a critical role in enabling seamless text and speech conversion across languages.

This project aims to develop a scalable and efficient multilingual translation system capable of handling both high-resource and low-resource languages using modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The pipeline integrates:

- Tokenization
- Sequence-to-sequence generation
- Transformer-based architectures
- Context-aware translation mechanisms

Testing demonstrated strong performance in high-resource language pairs while highlighting improvement areas for low-resource languages.
